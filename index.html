And if your love is anchored in the financial security someone provides, what will happen if their wealth evaporates? True love in its purest form transcends all conditions and superficial reasons. At the core of true love lies a bond that defies rational thought, the acceptance and appreciation of one another exactly as they are, regardless of what life may bring"
