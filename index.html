            If you fall in love because of someone's beauty, how will your feelings endure when the relentless march of time erodes their beauty?

            True love in its purest form transcends all conditions and superficial reasons. At the core of true love lies a bond that defies rational thought,
            the acceptance and appreciation of one another exactly as they are, regardless of what life may bring." },
